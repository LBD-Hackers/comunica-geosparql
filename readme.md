# Comunica geoSPARQL

This library is under development but should contain the full set of geoSPARQL methods so they can be included as [extension functions](https://comunica.dev/docs/query/advanced/extension_functions/) in [Comunica](https://comunica.dev/).

See examples under tests.

Please reach out if you would like to contribute!
